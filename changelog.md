- Added the brick house. It is a structure that can spawn inside of the "infinite plains" dimension.

- Added the dungeon. It is a very rare structure that spawns in the overworld. It contains tons of mobs but has extremely good loot

- Added titanium bars â€“ made for prisons, it is harder than reinforced deepslate.

- Added "better bonemeal", which has a 1 in 4 chance of breaking upon right-clicking on a corrupted flower. The other 3 times, the flower duplicates. When the bonemeal breaks it removes 4 from the stack.
